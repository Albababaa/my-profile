				<h1>Hello, I'm Alba!</h1>

				<p>
				Hola!! My Name is Alba de la Fuente. I grew up in a multicultural environment betwen my spanish side and my french side. I have led a pretty international life and met so many people with different cultural backgrounds. Also, as i've constantly visiting many places around the world throughout my vacations, India and Iceland being one of my favourite places, I have become curious and open-minded. I'm currently living in Cergy, were I'm studying a degree in Business Administration at <a href="https://www.essec.edu/en/" target="_blank">ESSEC Business School</p>

				<h2>My associations</h2>
				<p>
				I'm currently a member of two associations in ESSEC. One of them is <a href="https://fr-fr.facebook.com/modessec.essec/" target="_blank">MODESSEC</a> which is the Mode association created to promote fashion, style of everyone and expression among the ESSEC student community. My role, as a member of the communication and event department, is mainly the creation of digital content to promote the association and events organized the world of fashion.
				</p>
				</p> 
				I'm also a member of a citizen/caricative associsation called <a href="https://fr-fr.facebook.com/sariessec.org/" target="_blank">SARI</a> of which I am the vice president. My role is to help the president manage the functioning and the communication within the association. I am also responsible for the events department on campus, mainly for charitable purposes and to raise funds and awareness but also to promote Indian culture.</p>

				<h2>Travel</h2>
				<p>
				I love travelling, discovering new cultures, meeting new people,etc. In my opinion, seeing the world is more educational than a high school or college class. When we travel, we have the possibility of learning a new language, a new cuisine, aspects of a different culture, or even acquiring a deeper appreciation of faith or spirituality. 
				</p>
				</p>
				Also, I feel like travelling helps to open your mind. You realize that there’s no one way to live life. Especially, meeting people from other places will show you that your world view isn’t the same as everyone else’s.

				<h2>Litterature</h2>
				<p>
				Passionate about literature since very young, reading is another way for me to travel. To travel in different universes, to live a thousand different lives and be who I want to be. Reading allows us to disconnect from reality for a few pages.
				</p>
				</p> 
				But reading is also a way to learn. Reading allows me to develop my knowledge and thus to form an opinion on subjects that intrigue and interest me.
